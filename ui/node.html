	 npm makes it easy for JavaScript developers to share and reuse code, and it makes it easy to update the code that you're sharing. In order to install npm, you need to install node.js first. Run following command 
{% highlight ruby %} 
node -v
{% endhighlight %}
Run node -v. The version should be higher than v0.10.32.
<p>
Node comes with npm installed so you should have a version of npm. However, npm gets updated more frequently than Node does, so you'll want to make sure it's the latest version.
{% highlight ruby %} 
sudo npm install npm -g.
{% endhighlight %}
Test: Run npm -v. The version should be higher than 2.1.8.
</li>
</ol></div>
