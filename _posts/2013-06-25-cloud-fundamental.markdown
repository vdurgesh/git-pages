By Defination, "Cloud Computing is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server.""

"Cloud means network of networks providing remote access to set of decentralized IT resources."

".. a style of computing in which scalable and elastic IT-enabled capabilities are delivered as service to external customers using internate technologies."


"... a standardized IT capability (services, software, or infrastructure) delivered via internat technologies in a pay-per-use, self service way."

Capacity planning, cost reduction, and organizational agility are primary features that exposed the need for cloud computing.
