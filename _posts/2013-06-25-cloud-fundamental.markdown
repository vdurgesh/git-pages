By Defination, "Cloud Computing is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server.""

"Cloud means network of networks providing remote access to set of decentralized IT resources."

".. a style of computing in which scalable and elastic IT-enabled capabilities are delivered as service to external customers using internate technologies."


"... a standardized IT capability (services, software, or infrastructure) delivered via internat technologies in a pay-per-use, self service way."

Capacity planning, cost reduction, and organizational agility are primary features that exposed the need for cloud computing.

A Cloud service is any IT Resouces that is made remotally accessible via a cloud.

An on the premises network (within an organization boundary) of a controlled IT environment is not a cloud.

There can be two type of scaling on cloud 

	1. Horizontal Scaling (Resource out and in)
	2. Vertical Scaling (Resource up and down)



Three common cloud delivery models:

	1. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
		This can include hardware, network, connectivity, operating system and other raw IT Resources. 
	2. Platform as a service (PasS)
		This represents a "ready to use" environment.
	3. Software as a service (SasS)
		A software product or utility deplyed as a share cloud service.



More common deployment models are :

	1. Public clouds
	2. Community clouds
	3. Private clouds
	4. Hybrid clouds
