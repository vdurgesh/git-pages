How often we wish for another chance, to make a fresh begining, a chance to blot out our mistakes. And change failure info winning. It does not take a special time, To make a brand new start it only takes the deep desire. To try with all out heart, To live a little better, and to always be forgiving, to add a little sunshinein a world for which we are living, So Never give up in despair Nor think you are though, for there's always a tomorrow And a chance to start a new.
