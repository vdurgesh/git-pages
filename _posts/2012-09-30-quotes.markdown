You cannot judge a tree, or a person, by only one season,  and that the essence of who they are and the pleasure, joy, and love that come from that life can only be measured at the end, when all the seasons are up.
If you give up when it's winter, you will miss the promise of your spring, the beauty of your summer, and fulfillment of your fall. In short, Don't let the pain of one season destroy the joy of all the rest. Don't judge life by one difficult season.
