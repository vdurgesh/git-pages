It's sad that we are turning the programme in a direction where it will reduce the amount of motivation and stimulation it provides to young people.--Neil Armstrong </p>

        <p class="lead">You cannot judge a tree, or a person, by only one season,  and that the essence of who they are and the pleasure, joy, and love that come from that life can only be measured at the end, when all the seasons are up.
If you give up when it's winter, you will miss the promise of your spring, the beauty of your summer, and fulfillment of your fall. In short, Don't let the pain of one season destroy the joy of all the rest. Don't judge life by one difficult season.</p>

        <p class="lead">Enthusiasm is one of the most powerful engines of success. When you do a thing, do it with all your mind. Put your whole soul to it. Stamp it with your own personality. Be active, be energetic, be enthusiastic and faithful, and you will accomplish your object. Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm. -- Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>

        <p class="lead">Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.--Swami Vivekananda </p>

        <p class="lead">If you're trying to achieve, there will be roadblocks. I've had them; everybody has had them. But obstacles don't have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it.-- Michael Jordan</p>

        <p class="lead">“Freedom from activity is never achieved by abstaining from action. Nobody can become perfect by merely ceasing to act. In fact, nobody can ever rest from his activity even for a moment. All are helplessly forced to act. . . .
A man who renounces certain physical actions but still lets his mind dwell on the objects of his sensual desire, is deceiving himself. He can only be called a hypocrite. The truly admirable man controls his senses by the power of his will. All his actions will be disinterested. 
Activity is better than inertia. Act, but with self-control. If you are lazy, you cannot even sustain your own body.”― Bhagavad Gita </p>

          How often we wish for another chance, to make a fresh begining, a chance to blot out our mistakes. And change failure info winning. It does not take a special time, To make a brand new start it only takes the deep desire. To try with all out heart, To live a little better, and to always be forgiving, to add a little sunshinein a world for which we are living, So Never give up in despair Nor think you are though, for there's always a tomorrow And a chance to start a new.

          "Do you known how much energy, how many powers, how many forces are still lurking behind that frame of yours? What scientist has known all that is in man? Millions of years have passed since man first came here, and yet but one infinitesimal part of his powers has been manifested. Therefore, you must not say that you are weak. How do you know what possibilities lie behind that degradation on the surface? You know but little of that which is within you. For behind you is the ocean of infinite power and blessedness." -Swami Vivekananda
